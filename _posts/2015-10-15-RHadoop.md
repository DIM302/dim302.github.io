This is a guide to integrating R and Hadoop through Amazon EMR.  It assumes that you have already set up an EC2 instance and have a key pair.

# Guide to Runnng RHadoop over Amazon EMR #

###  Assumptions ###

That you have already set up an [Amazon AWS](http://aws.amazon.com/) account.
That you have basic knowledge of the following: <br>
- [Amazon EMR (Elastic MapReduce)](http://aws.amazon.com/elasticmapreduce/) <br>
- [Amazon S3 (Simple Storage)](http://aws.amazon.com/s3/) <br>
- [Amazon EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud)](http://aws.amazon.com/ec2/) <br>
- [R Programming](https://www.r-project.org/) <br>

### Setting up Elastic Map Reduce ###

Step 1: Log into [Amazon AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/)

Step 2: Click the EMR icon - Managed Hadoop Framework <br><br>

Step 3: Create you cluster <br>
- Click "Create cluster" and select "Go to advanced options" at the top of the page <br>
- Give your cluster a name <br>
- Log folder S3 location - Select any location in S3 for logs <br>
- Software configuration - This demo is done using emr-4.1.0 <br>
- Add any applications you are interested in using, such as Spark or Mahout <br>
- Choose your EC2 instance - this example is done using m1.xlarge <br><br>

- Chose your EC2 key pair <br>
- <b> IMPORTANT BOOTSTRAP INSTRUCTION </b><br>
1. Download the [Amazon EMR Boostrap File](https://docs.google.com/uc?authuser=0&id=0B_DFy-IMDAf4aENDYXdVeGhOV3M&export=download)
2. Open a new tab and upload the .sh script into your S3 (either create a new folder/bucket in S3 or use an existing folder)
3. Within EMR, select "custom action" from the "Select a boostrap action" drop down.  Then select "Configure and add"
4. Link the above .sh file in "S3 location" and press "Add" <br><br>

-  Select any other fields as you wish and click on the "Create cluster" button

IMPORTANT NOTE: <br>
The cluster will show  "starting", but the bootstrapping script, the cluster will take around 15-60 minutes to full complete the setup process.  During the process, DO NOT refresh you browswer.  If you do, your cluster may say "Waiting", in which case the cluster must be [terminated](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/ElasticMapReduce/latest/DeveloperGuide/UsingEMR_TerminateJobFlow.html) or it will run indefinitely.  You can monitor the process through [Amazon CloudWatch](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/ElasticMapReduce/latest/ManagementGuide/UsingEMR_ViewingMetrics.html)

Initial Stage: <br>
- All steps should be "Pending"

Second Stage: <br>
- Progress should be shown as "Bootstrapping"

Final Stage: <br>
- Cluster will be shown as "Running"
- Your EMR cluster is now ready to be used with RHadoop.

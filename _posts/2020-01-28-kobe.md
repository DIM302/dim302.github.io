<b>The Legendary Career of Kobe Bryant Visualized in Data</b>

By: Drew Malter, Danny Malter

To reflect on Kobe’s greatness after his tragic passing with his daughter Gigi, we have created several data visualizations to showcase his dominant career using the ggplot2 library in R.  

Below is a shot chart containing all 30,699 shots that he took in his career, separating his makes from his misses.  There’s essentially nowhere on the court that he didn’t like to score from, but he especially excelled from the shoulders and baseline.

When looking at the frequency of Kobe’s shooting over the course of the game, it’s apparent that the superstar wants the ball as the clock approaches zero.  Kobe often got his rest in the first 6 minutes of each half, accounting for the dips on those regions of the chart.  The below histogram is a chart showing which teams where handed the most late-game daggers from Kobe.

Next, we’re looking at the trend of Kobe’s shot accuracy over the course of his career.   Early in his career, he struggled to maintain the same success in the playoffs that he had in the regular season, but that eventually changed as he made his way to his 5 championships.   The most impressive part of these charts, however, is that 17 seasons into his career he was shooting as well as he ever had been.

The below three charts compliment what we’ve seen so far, but broken down by opponent, shot type and shot range.   Most of his better numbers came from Western conference teams, perhaps due to less travel, but also likely due to his competitive nature of wanting to dominate his rivals.  However, among all the Eastern conference teams, Kobe always played his best in the spotlight against New York.

![plot of chunk unnamed-chunk-10](/figure/2020-01-28-kobe/image10.png)

The below chart shows the impressive constant shot improvement from Kobe over the course of the season.  Like most NBA players, he does show a slight decline late in the season as the fatigue from his ‘always give 100%’ mentality eventually kicks in.  He also consistently was near the top of the league in games and minutes played.  However, when the playoffs enter the picture, Kobe has historically put his fatigue aside and outperformed his regular-season-self.   The June decline can likely be attributed to a small sample size of playing the leagues best defenders in the NBA finals.

When looking at his success distributed over the course of the game, the results are similar in a few ways.  Kobe remains consistent and does show a predictable slight dip in the 4th quarter, but is somehow able to rejuvenate himself for overtime.
